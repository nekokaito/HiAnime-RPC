## About
Just got bored and made this small project — a **Discord Rich Presence** integration for [HiAnime.to](https://hianime.to).  
Since the site doesn’t allow opening the dev console, I had to rely on **reverse engineering** the website to extract the required info.  

## Features
- Shows what you are watching on HiAnime in your **Discord Rich Presence**  
- Auto-updates while watching  
- Lightweight and simple  

## Tech
- Built with Node.js  
- Uses Discord RPC  
- Data extracted via reverse-engineering (since console access is blocked on HiAnime)  

##  Usage

# Step 1
- Run ```run-win.bat```

or

- Run ```run-bash.sh```

# Step 2

- Open Chrome and go to: ```chrome://extensions/```

- Enable Developer Mode (top right corner).

- Click Load unpacked and select this project folder's extension.

- Open HiAnime and start watching
